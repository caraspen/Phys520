## Git Assignment Phys 520
1. I enjoy using Git because of the version control features it offers (you don't have to worry about bugging a bunch of code if you want to try something, you can just create a local repo) and it's really useful when you're collaborating with a group of people. 

2. One of the things that I dislike about Git is that it seems like a simple idea (think Google docs and then copying from it and changing it locally on your desktop before you change the shared document) but I feel like it's made overly complex with the concept of branching/merging/ect.

3. I still don't quite understand merge conflicts - I know it was talked about in Thursday's class but I wouldn't mind going through merging and merge conflicts at least once more.
